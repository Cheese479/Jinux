Jinux is an OS (obviously) on v0.02 right now and currently has a few commands
you can do by typing 'help', its very barebones right now but in the next 2 weeks
I plan to add jlibc (Jinux C Library), a tiny BASIC interpreter (J-BASIC), and even a very simple FS.
But yeah, not much right now, check back in a few days for more progress!
