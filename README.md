Jinux is an OS (obviously) on v0.03 right now and currently has a few commands
you can do by typing 'help', its very barebones right now but in the next few weeks
I plan to add more jlibc (Jinux C Library) (already has a few functions), a tiny BASIC interpreter (J-BASIC), and even a very simple FS.
But yeah, not much right now.
